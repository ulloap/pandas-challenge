Module 4 challenge

Description - I worked on this module through Jupyter by using Pandas. At the top, my analysis of the project is written out, followed by a wide range of DataSets that were manipulated throughout, in order to write a thorough and well thought out analysis.

Credits - I would like to give credit to the mentors working with "AskBCS Learning Assistant" on Slack. Many of them in different occasions helped me get through codes that I felt I was stuck on for a while. I used a couple of online websites in order to help me map out my code, and give me different ideas on how to write them correctly. They are as follow:

I would also like to mention, ChatGPT gave me brilliant code examples for what I was looking for, and I worked off of the base code template that was provided to us.
